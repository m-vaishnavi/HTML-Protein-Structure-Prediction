### Prediction of secondary and three-dimensional structure for Protein - K8G1J4 using HTML, JavaScript (Jmol and Jsmol)

Predicted secondary and three-dimensional structure using an advanced secondary structure prediction algorithm and a homology modeling algorithm, respectively for the Protein - K8G1J4 and analyzed the quality of the model using one of the structure validation or verification tools. Identified structural classification of the model and compared the predicted secondary structures with the secondary structures in 3D model.
